# Note_Taker_2021
<h1 style="align: center;">Note Taker 👋</h1>

## 🔍 Description
This repository contains one of the very interesting phase 2 homework assignments for the Programming course at University of Birmingham: the 'Note Taker'. This app is designed, not just for any targeted demographic, but for potentially every working person around the world. It helps users to store their tasks or memories in the form of 'notes', and then delete them once achieved or irrelevant. This app makes it possible for users to achieve all their tasks easily because of having all of them listed on the page and, therefore, always visible to accomplish, delete, and add new items.

## 💾 Installation
There are no installation liabilities for users to take advantage of this app. All you have to do is follow the link to the deployed app below, and use it to your own convenience. The use for this app, however, comes with one caveat: the server (myself) must be notified about the app being activated for use, so that the relevant installations must be made in order to run the app in the browser, which must also be made in the case of pulling my repository to your local machine. The back-end installations include the following:

- VS Code
- Node.js
- Express.js (because this app is an express app)
- Uniqid (to assign each note added to the list with unique id's) 

## ⚙️ Instructions
Install the packages in the node.js server using the following commands:

> npm install express <br>
> npm install uniqid

After installing the relevant apps and packages defined above, the user must run the following command in the server in order to run the app in the browser:

> node server.js --> (because the request is responded through the server.js file)

In order to kill the run command, simply press 'Ctrl + C' in the server. This terminates the rendering of the app in the browser.

## 💻 Usage
Read the instructions and use the app at all times, but do ensure that the 'node server.js' command is always running in the server.
